    description: "My favorite! This is a subscription platform I built that helps devs learn MERN stack (previously called it mernguide.com ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) by building fully deployed project from scratch - no abstractions. The one course up there follows the process of building and deploying the e-commerce site gallacticcat.com - when I was learning I was isolated and frustrated. In the world of web development there are so many different frameworks and things to learn, I felt daunted and bummed to be alone while learning. To alleviate that every course on MERNguide has a Discord channel dedicated to the students so they can share ideas, ask questions, etc. Every course lesson comes with a video guide and repo commits as well."

Integrated with Stripe hosted checkout and full functional. Outlined the process of building this site within my MERNguide.com site to help provide a path to other aspiring fullstack devs."

    description: "My very first fully deployed project. A simple budgeting tool that aligns to the Japanese budgeting philosophy of kakeibo. In kakeibo expenses are categorized as NEED, WANT, CULTURAL, UNEXPECTED to reinforce mindful spending. Within this project users create expenses and categorize them. Once categorized a user can see all their spending broken down visually in a nice circle graph."

    description: "Friend of mine bought a chimney service in San Diego and needed a website, so I built and deployed this for him. The fun part about this site is it has a form for users to fill out when they request a quote. My friend uses a CRM called Ontraport to organize contact information so I built an integration. When users submit, the request quote form a new lead is generated in his Ontraport CRM."
