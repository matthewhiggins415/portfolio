    description: "This is a subscription platform I built that helps devs learn MERN stack by building fully deployed project from scratch - no abstractions. The one course up there follows the process of building and deploying the e-commerce site gallacticcat.com - when I was learning I was isolated and frustrated. In the world of web development there are so many different frameworks and things to learn, I felt daunted and bummed to be alone while learning. To alleviate that every course on MERNguide has a Discord channel dedicated to the students so they can share ideas, ask questions, etc. Every course lesson comes with a video guide and repo commits as well."

    description: "My very first fully deployed project. A simple budgeting tool that aligns to the Japanese budgeting philosophy of kakeibo. In kakeibo expenses are categorized as NEED, WANT, CULTURAL, UNEXPECTED to reinforce mindful spending. Within this project users create expenses and categorize them. Once categorized a user can see all their spending broken down visually in a nice circle graph."
